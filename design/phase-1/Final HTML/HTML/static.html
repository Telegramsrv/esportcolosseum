                         <div class="st-ttl"> Retention and Use of Personal Information</div>
This Privacy Policy discloses the online privacy practices for Unikrn, Inc. and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, partners, agents, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, successors and assigns, third party suppliers of information and documents, attorneys, accountants, advertisers, product and service providers (collectively, "Unikrn" or "We" or "Us" or "Our") and applies to the information We collect from persons accessing, using, and/or registering on Unikrn.com (the "Site" ). By accessing, using, and/or registering on the Site, you, including your parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, partners, agents, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, successors and assigns, third party suppliers of information ("Services"), and the Site.

<div class="st-ttl">Retention and Use of Personal Information</div>
Unikrn respects Your ability to make informed choices about the collection and use of Your personal information.
